# Get-Live-Cooper-Price-With-VBA

[2016.03]

Tools needed: MS Excel 2010+  and Visual Basic for Applications 

The macro connects to a live webpage http://www.westmetall.com  and extracts data from "Monatsdurchschnitte" which is processed in a chart and saved as an image file.

Furthermore some external web page could read the image file and prints out on the screen as part of a Dashboard.

Note: Excel macro file won't run unless you set up your own directory path to be used for saving the images
